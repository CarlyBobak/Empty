Oh look a file about mars. 

Mars ATTACKS.

AHHHHHHH.Everyone dies.

Suddenly, Matt Damon rises from the dead and has to learn how to grow food
on mars. Everyone's ghosts (becases everyone else is dead) are entertained by his eternally optimistic attitude despite
the dire circumstances.

He returns to earth only to find a small cleaning robot named Wall-E left.
They fall in love.
